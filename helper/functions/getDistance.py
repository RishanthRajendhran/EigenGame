#Function to return the distance measure 
# between current player positions (current eigenvalues) 
# and expected final player positions (i.e. expected eigenvalues)
#Inputs
#   V   - Current player positions
#   EVs - Expected final player positions
#Outputs
#   Returns a scalar distance measure
def getDistance(V, EVs):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((V - EVs) ** 2))      #Euclidean distance
